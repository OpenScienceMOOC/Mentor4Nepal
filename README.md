#Mentor4Nepal Initiative is for recent graduates and early career professionals focusing on the enhancement of one’s skill set, support for a research project, and a collaborative publication. Various sector such as #engineering, #environmentalscience, #forestry, #agriculture, #transportation, #publichealth, #management and #informationtechnology can take advantage of both #geospatial and artificial technologies (GeoAI).Geospatial technology associates any problem with coordinates and gives us a better picture of how things are located, related and changing. #GeoAI is utilizing AI for intelligent geographic information such as image classification, object detection, scene segmentation, simulation and interpolation, link prediction, (natural language-based) retrieval and question answering, on-the-fly data integration, geo-enrichment, and many others (https://doi.org/10.1080/13658816.2019.1684500). Thus, an application can be broad and can be utilized to answer any research gap that you feel in our society and supports the UN's SDGs (https://doi.org/10.18494/SAM.2019.2706). The concept can be small and viable considering one's situation.

Theme: Application of geospatial technologies and artificial intelligence (GeoAI). The field is not limited and the project can be object detection such as land cover and features, supporting sustainable development goals in the land, water, forest, crop and energy dynamics, linking people’s perception, activities, government action/policy to climate change etc.

A project can be an individual or a group (3 max.). Priority will be given to novelty, use of open access data, tools and impact to the society. Financial support can be provided for a promising project depending on the necessity and impact of the work. It is voluntary participation for your future growth, especially in academia.  It will focus on the enhancement of one’s skill set. The concept will be yours and you will be leading the project to a successful first-authored publication. I will simply guide you by answering your queries, linking the right resources and step-by-step process of academic research and publication.

Interested candidates (National and International) can email me at tridevacharya[at]gmail.com with their queries. To initiate any collaboration for their desired mini-project (can be simple at this stage), please complete the following instructions (use any one method to create sharable folder):
- 1. [Preferred] For better collaborative writing, install BOX Drive in your Laptop/Computer via https://e3.boxcdn.net/box-installers/desktop/releases/win/Box-x64.msi. Signup with Google https://account.box.com/signup/personal?tc=annual for 10GB cloud space and go to https://app.box.com/ then create a folder name (see right top corner): Mentor4Nepal_FullFirstNameInitialLastName_TDA. eg. Mentor4Nepal_TriDevA_TDA. While creating add both of my email address: tridevacharya@gmail[dot]com and tdacharya[at]ucdavis.edu in the "Invite Additonal People" as Editor. Now, this folder is shared with me and I can also edit everything.
- 2. For fast intenet with SSO accounts and who are comfortable with online Google File Stream Drive install via https://dl.google.com/drive-file-stream/GoogleDriveFSSetup.exe and create a shared drive: Mentor4Nepal_FullFirstNameInitialLastName_TDA. eg. Mentor4Nepal_TriDevA_TDA. Add contributor with email address: tridevacharya@gmail[dot]com. Now, this drive is shared with me and I can also edit everything.
- 3. [Google is phasing out and shifting to step 2]For slower internet or offline working, install Google Drive in your Laptop/Computer. https://dl.google.com/tag/s/appguid%3D%7B3C122445-AECE-4309-90B7-85A6AEF42AC0%7D%26iid%3D%7B9648D435-67BA-D2A7-54D2-1E0B5656BF03%7D%26ap%3Duploader%26appname%3DBackup%2520and%2520Sync%26needsadmin%3Dtrue/drive/installbackupandsync.exe . Go to https://drive.google.com/ and create a folder name: Mentor4Nepal_FullFirstNameInitialLastName_TDA. e.g. Mentor4Nepal_TriDevA_TDA. Select that folder and you will see a human and plus symbol, add there my email address: tridevacharya@gmail[dot]com. Now, this folder is shared with me and I can also edit everything. 
- Add MiniProject_applicaiton (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pm88SIC2nj1vLPFRRX1k7ld4nJ-os2Jd6mZiMuJtTck) in the folder and try to fill as much as possible. Simple ideas are welcome and can be improved collaboratively over time.
- I will add a few files and folders later, then we will work together on them as the next step.
- Install Mendeley via https://desktop-download.mendeley.com/download/Mendeley-Desktop-1.19.8-win32.exe. Create account wtih your gmail and login. Finally watch this tutorial https://youtu.be/H4osP8Gp3Kk. To collaborate, create group and invite my and other members gmail, install word and browser plugin and start importing bibliography on the group not private folder.

In addition, one should think of it as an opportunity to create a life-long mentor-mentee relationship to help each other for a long-term career via Facebook Group [Request only approved after a sucessful proposal of a project]. A one-on-one career counselling will be provided along with a tailored career/research guide based on one’s interest and future milestones such as Education, Job, Investment, Settlement, Marriage, Partner's career, Kids, Family, Society etc. Understanding these milestones from an early age and balancing them is the key to a happy future. Read: https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10159465595218501&id=795108500 . 

To share the progress and reflect on the blocks, a half an hour biweekly meeting is preferred. One may go to Google Calendar https://calendar.google.com/ and create a biweekly meeting as "Biweekly Meeting: InitialsFirstLastName_TDA" e.g. Biweekly Meeting: TDA_TDA adding me as a guest with my Gmail only. For Nepal, 6-9:00 AM is fine with me. **Do check**, Modify events for guests so that I can adjust time as per my schedule.

 Improving English of your writings: </br>
- Use MS Word Editor: First go to your Review tab, select your language (British or American English) and then open the editor to check spellings and grammar. </br>
- Use external tools such as Grammarly: Install MS Office and Chrome plugins: https://app.grammarly.com/apps and use them to check grammar at the end of the above process. </br>
- [ALERT] Use Google/Word Docs Online: As you will be working on Google Drive or BOX with me, you may also open the file with Google Docs (GD online erases the format and cant use refence via mendeley) or Word online (in BOX you can use open with word online) and it will check English by default. </br>
