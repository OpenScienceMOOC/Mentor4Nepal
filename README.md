# Mentor4Nepal

<div align="justify"> 

#Mentor4Nepal Initiative is for recent graduates and early career professionals focusing on the enhancement of one’s skill set, support for a research project, and a collaborative publication. Various sector such as #engineering, #environmentalscience, #forestry, #agriculture, #publichealth, #management and #informationtechnology can take advantage of both #geospatial and artificial technologies (GeoAI).Geospatial technology associates any problem with coordinates and gives us a better picture of how things are located, related and changing. #GeoAI is utilizing AI for intelligent geographic information such as image classification, object detection, scene segmentation, simulation and interpolation, link prediction, (natural language-based) retrieval and question answering, on-the-fly data integration, geo-enrichment, and many others (https://doi.org/10.1080/13658816.2019.1684500). Thus, an application can be broad and can be utilized to answer any research gap that you feel in our society and supports the UN's SDGs (https://doi.org/10.18494/SAM.2019.2706). The concept can be small and viable considering the one's situation.

Theme: Application of geospatial technologies and artificial intelligence (GeoAI). The field is not limited and the project can be object detection such as land cover and features, supporting sustainable development goals in the land, water, forest, crop and energy dynamics, linking people’s perception, activities, government action/policy to climate change etc.

A project can be an individual or a group (3 max.). Priority will be given to novelty, use of open access data, tools and impact to the society. Financial support can be provided for a promising project depending on the necessity and impact of the work. It is voluntary participation for your future growth especially in academia, not a funding opportunity to earn a living. The concept will be yours and you will be leading the project to a successful first-authored publication. I will simply guide you by answering your queries, linking the right resources and step-by-step process of academic research and publication.

Interested candidates can contact me (Email: tridevacharya[at]kangwon.ac.kr) with a filled form (Available: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pm88SIC2nj1vLPFRRX1k7ld4nJ-os2Jd6mZiMuJtTck/edit?usp=sharing) for further discussion.
