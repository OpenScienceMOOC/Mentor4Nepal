#Mentor4Nepal Initiative is for recent graduates and early career professionals focusing on the enhancement of oneâ€™s skill set, support for a research project, and a collaborative publication. Various sector such as #engineering, #environmentalscience, #forestry, #agriculture, #transportation, #publichealth, #management and #informationtechnology can take advantage of both #geospatial and artificial technologies (GeoAI).Geospatial technology associates any problem with coordinates and gives us a better picture of how things are located, related and changing. #GeoAI is utilizing AI for intelligent geographic information such as image classification, object detection, scene segmentation, simulation and interpolation, link prediction, (natural language-based) retrieval and question answering, on-the-fly data integration, geo-enrichment, and many others (https://doi.org/10.1080/13658816.2019.1684500). Thus, an application can be broad and can be utilized to answer any research gap that you feel in our society and supports the UN's SDGs (https://doi.org/10.18494/SAM.2019.2706). The concept can be small and viable considering one's situation.

This is meant to be a collaborative endeavor, so if you have things to add, you're more than welcome to contribute by <a href="mailto:tridevacharya@gmail.com?subject=contributing to #Mentor4Nepal Initiative">sending me an email</a>.
